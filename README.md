**Intelligent Freight Forecasting & Charter Optimization for Bulk Cargo Procurement**

Built for **SIH26006** — Ministry of Steel, Smart India Hackathon 2026

> Predicting freight rates, scoring shipping disruptions, and recommending optimal vessel chartering & procurement timing for bulk cargo (iron ore, coking coal) shipped to India's East Coast ports.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

**SIH26006 — Development of an Intelligent Freight Forecasting Model for Optimized Vessel Chartering and Bulk Cargo Procurement from overseas to East Coast of India**

Steel plants procuring bulk raw materials (iron ore, coking coal) via overseas shipping face volatile freight rates, unpredictable disruptions (cyclones, port congestion, geopolitical events), and reactive, manual chartering decisions — leading to avoidable cost overruns.

CargoCast forecasts freight rates and cargo demand, scores real-time disruption risk from shipping news, and recommends data-backed charter/procurement decisions — with a live scenario simulator and quantified cost-savings estimate.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📈 **ML-based freight rate & demand forecasting** with confidence intervals (LightGBM / XGBoost / Prophet)
- 📰 **NLP-driven disruption scoring** from shipping news (strikes, cyclones, route delays)
- 🧭 **Explainable decision engine** — spot vs. time-charter selection, buy-now vs. wait timing
- 🎛️ **Live scenario simulator** — stress-test fuel price shocks, port delays, demand spikes
- 💰 **Quantified cost-savings estimator** — model strategy vs. naive baseline, in ₹
- 📊 **Interactive Streamlit dashboard** — forecasts, recommendations, and scenario controls in one view
